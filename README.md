# rtc.io "Hello World" demo

This is a demonstration app that provides you a starting point for building your first video conferencing application using [rtc.io](http://rtc.io/). The demo aims to ease you into working with rtc.io through using the prebuilt [`rtc.js`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc) bundle.  If you are comfortable using with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) then you should be able to dig and use some of the lower-level packages such as [`rtc-quickconnect`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc) and [others](http://rtc.io/modules.html) after playing with this demo.

## build.rtc.io ready

This is a demo that has been constructed from the ground-up to be compatible with a soon to be released hosted build service that will produce WebRTC enabled iOS applications in process similar to (and inspired by) [PhoneGap build](http://build.phonegap.com).
