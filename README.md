# rtc.io "Hello World" demo

This is a demonstration app that provides you a starting point for building your first video conferencing application using [rtc.io](http://rtc.io/). The demo aims to ease you into working with rtc.io through using the prebuilt [`rtc.js`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc) bundle.  If you are comfortable using with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) then you should be able to dig and use some of the lower-level packages such as [`rtc-quickconnect`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc) and [others](http://rtc.io/modules.html) after playing with this demo.
